<h1>Horiseon Challenge: Refactoring<h1>

<h2>Dependencies<h2>:

No prerequisites needed for running this website.

<h2>How to run the program:<h2>

 - this is single page website mock-up.
 - the links on header navigation lead to the divisions lower on the page.
 - this page has not yet been adapted for any screen size beyond a desktop.
 - css selectors have been consolidated from the original code for more simplicity and less repition.  
 
<h2>Any advise for common problems or issue:<h2>

Since the nav links go to the same page, depending on your window size, the link to the first division may behave strange, or not seem to navigate you.  Make your window smaller so less of the lower page is visible, and it should work properly.
