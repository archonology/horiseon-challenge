# horiseon-challenge

Source code has been refactored. 
I went through each line to ensure semantic HTML elements are in place, and I cleaned up the structure of the HTML elements. 
You will find that all elements now follow an elemental structure.
"alt" atributes have been added to each image.  

Heading attributes have been organized correctly, and a concise, descriptive tile has been added: "Horiseon"
THe links have all been checked, and all three are functional.  
I modified the names of some of the selectors and ids to make them quicker to write out.
